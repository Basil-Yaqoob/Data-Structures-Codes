Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository
Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository by Basil-Yaqoob! This repository is designed to provide a comprehensive collection of optimized and easy-to-understand code implementations for various data structures, algorithms, trees, graphs, and backtracking problems commonly encountered in computer science courses, particularly in the study of DSA.

What You'll Find:
Sorting Algorithms: All sorting algorithms are consolidated into a single "Sorting" file. Each type of sorting algorithm is extensively commented below one another for easy reference and understanding.
Data Structures and Traversal: Individual files are provided for different types of trees and their traversal methods. The code is structured to enhance understanding without relying on external libraries like maps, using classes to create maps where necessary.
Graph Problems: Separate files are dedicated to different graph problems, ensuring clarity and focused learning. No maps library has been used; instead, maps are created via classes to reinforce conceptual understanding.
Backtracking Problems: Various common backtracking problems are provided in separate files, allowing for focused study and practice.
Optimized and Easy-to-Understand Code: The codes are optimized for efficiency and readability, with detailed comments explaining the logic and implementation details.
